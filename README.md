# Hyperpilot 2.0
Mapsforge/VTM rendering theme for pilots.

Best suited for [OpenAndroMaps](https://www.openandromaps.org/en/downloads/countrys-and-regions) offline maps and [XCTrack](https://xctrack.org/), but can be used with any software supporting VTM themes.

For the old version, based on VTM's default theme, look at the [1.0 branch](https://github.com/hyperknot/hyperpilot/tree/1.0).
